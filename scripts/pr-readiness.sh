# The readiness gate: everything that has to be true before a pull request in this loop is
# called done. A green build is not a merge-ready pull request - the check can pass on a
# branch that is behind, a review can be outstanding, a conversation can be unresolved, and
# the ticket can name nothing - so the six facts a person would look at are read here, each
# with a verdict and a reason.
#
#   scripts/pr-readiness.sh                 every open pull request targeting the default
#                                           branch, one block per pull request: the six
#                                           criteria, each with a verdict and a reason
#   scripts/pr-readiness.sh --pr <number>    only that pull request (still all six criteria),
#                                           so one PR can be judged without reading the queue
#   scripts/pr-readiness.sh --ready         only the pull requests that pass all six, one per
#                                           line: <number> <sha> <branch> <title> (nothing
#                                           when none does); composes with --pr
#   scripts/pr-readiness.sh --self-test      a stub gh and bd prove every criterion fails alone
#
# A pull request is ready only when all six hold:
#   ci             the project's own check (the `check` command in .loop.toml) ran on the head
#                  commit, and every check run concluded successfully; a run that is still
#                  queued, or concluded neutral, skipped or cancelled, is not a success, and a
#                  commit CI never ran has none however green an unrelated run looks
#   conversations  no review conversation (threaded review comment) is unresolved
#   changes        no review is outstanding as changes requested
#   review         the commit status named by review_context in .loop.toml is success on the
#                  head commit; scripts/review-status.sh posts it
#   current        the merge state is current and clean: not behind the default branch, no
#                  conflicts, not a draft, not blocked
#   bead           the branch (ticket/<ID>) and the head commit subject (<ID>: ...) name the
#                  same Beads ticket, which exists, carries acceptance criteria, and is
#                  claimed (in_progress) or closed, with an owner
#
# The queue is the open pull requests that target the default branch, read 200 at a time, and
# --pr is the same judgement for one of them. The output is a verdict, so this is a report and
# not a second check: it exits 0 even when nothing is ready (--ready is how the owner sees what
# is), and only fails when the queue itself cannot be read or a named pull request does not
# exist. Needs `gh` authenticated for this repository, `bd` with this repository's database,
# and python3 for the ticket JSON.
