# Fails when a branch ruleset requires a status check the workflow it was written for never
# reports (LK-13). A required context is satisfied by a check run of that name and no other, so
# a ruleset naming a job the workflow does not have holds every pull request forever while every
# other check is green - and a green ruleset that names a job is exactly what a person checking
# by eye sees. That is how this repository's own ci/ruleset.json would have behaved had LK-09
# applied it unread: the kit's job is `Check (check.sh)` and the template says
# `Check (scripts/check.sh)`, which no job here will ever report.
#
#   scripts/ruleset-check.sh <ruleset.json> <workflow.yml> [<ruleset.json> <workflow.yml> ...]
#                                                      each pair is a ruleset and the workflow
#                                                      whose job names must be its contexts
#   scripts/ruleset-check.sh --self-test                a fixture pair proves the verdict
#
# A project applies ci/ruleset.json and runs ci/workflow.yml as .github/workflows/loop.yml, so
# the two are a pair there as well; a project's check names its own pair. The kit names both of
# its own - .github/ruleset.json with .github/workflows/ci.yml, and the template ci/ruleset.json
# with ci/workflow.yml - so neither pairing can drift unnoticed, and the template keeps the
# context a project's job actually reports.
#
# Only one direction is a fault. A required context with no job deadlocks every pull request; a
# job no ruleset requires is a check that runs and gates nothing, which is a choice. So the
# check is one-way: every context must name a job - with one exception (LK-22). The loop's own
# review status (`review_context` in .loop.toml) is not a job and cannot be one: scripts/
# review-status.sh posts it as a commit status from the owner's machine, which is what the README
# tells a project to require beside the job contexts. That one context is satisfied without a job;
# every other one still has to name one. The check cannot know whether the review actually runs -
# only that this context is the loop's to post rather than a workflow's.
#
# The workflow is read with perl and no YAML library, because the kit is bash, git, and perl. A
# job is a key at the smallest indent under `jobs:`; its name is the `name:` at the smallest
# indent inside that job, and a job with no `name:` is reported by its key, which is what GitHub
# uses as the context too. A step's `name:` is deeper, or a `- ` list item, and is not a status
# context, so it is never read as one.
